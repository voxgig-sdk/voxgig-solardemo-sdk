/* Ordering (§7) — one rule, one place.
 *
 * sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then
 * `station`) and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole
 * replacement, and the tiers are in this order for a reason:
 *
 *   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
 *   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
 *   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both
 * are present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a
 * constraint expresses a relationship between two specific things; and
 * a band chosen by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug
 * wearing a number. */

/** A PIN IS NOT A CONSTRAINT (§7).
 *
 * Constraints and bands are negotiable by definition — they are what
 * plugins and documents say they want, and the sort's job is to satisfy
 * them all. A pin is the host stating a structural invariant of its own
 * architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a
 * tie to a document.
 *
 * So a pin PLACES the binding at the named end, and an ordering that
 * would move it away is `plugin_order_pinned` — rejected, not honoured
 * into a broken wrap. Station's transport adapter must sit immediately
 * outside the base transport; an `order` list that moves it has to be
 * an error rather than a preference. */
