# Build, start the server, wait until it actually answers, run validate, and
# always stop the server again.
#
# Replaces:
#
#   npm run build && (npm start & echo $! > .server.pid) && sleep 3 && \
#     npm run validate; EXIT_CODE=$?; kill $(cat .server.pid) ...
#
# which had two independent defects:
#
#   1. `sleep 3` is a guess. On a loaded machine the server is not listening
#      yet and every validate check fails with ECONNREFUSED; the rest of the
#      time it is three seconds of nothing.
#
#   2. `$!` was the PID of the `npm start` WRAPPER, not of the `node` process
#      npm spawns. Killing the wrapper can leave the server holding the port,
#      so the next run dies with EADDRINUSE — the symptom the review recorded.
#      Starting node directly makes `$!` the process that owns the port.
#
# Readiness is polled against /api/planet, an endpoint that is already in the
# OpenAPI definition and already exercised by validate.ts. Deliberately NOT a
# new /health route: an endpoint the spec does not describe is exactly the
# drift this repo already carries for /debug.

# Probing first was the same bug as the pre-flight check above, in miniature:
# if ANYTHING answers, the loop exits on its first iteration and the dead-child
# branch is never reached — so a server that died on startup is
# indistinguishable from one that came up.
#
# --max-time also matters: a process can hold the port and accept connections
# without ever replying, and an untimed curl then waits forever — the probe
# hangs instead of reporting "not ready".
